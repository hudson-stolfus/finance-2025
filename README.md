## Topic
Create a program that helps students manage their personal finances by tracking account balances, income and expenses. The program should allow users to input details about their income sources and expenses, including the amount, category, and date of each transaction.
It should provide features to view the current balance, generate summaries of income and expenses over specified periods (e.g., weekly, monthly), and categorize expenses to show spending patterns. Additionally, the program should include functionality to update or delete existing entries and offer search and filter options to easily find specific transactions.

### TL;DR
Make a program that has/does the following:
- Account Balances
- Track Income
- Track Expenses
- Transaction Details (Income & Expense)
    - Amount, Category, Date, etc.
- View Current Balance
- Generate Summaries
    - Specific Time Periods
    - Categorize Expenses to show spending patterns
- Update or Delete existing entries
- Search and Filter to aid transaction searching

## Notes From Austin
- We only really need two pages here:
- The home page, and the page where you view all the transactions.
- Modals would help cut down on the clutter, and honestly, it's probably for the best.
